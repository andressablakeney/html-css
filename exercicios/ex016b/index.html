        <h2>Walt Disney Feature Animation</h2>
        <p>Sanders began his career as a character designer for Jim Henson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muppet_Babies_(1984_TV_series)" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Muppet Babies</a>. He soon became the head storyboard artist for <abbr title="Walt Disney Feature Animation">WDFA</abbr>. He also served as a storyboard artist, artistic director, production designer, and character designer on Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), and Mulan (1998). 
        In 1985, Sanders created a character named "Stitch" for an unsuccessful children's book pitch. When Sanders was the head storyboard artist for Disney Feature Animation, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner decided that, in the wake of a number of high-profile and large-budget Disney animated features during the mid-1990s, the studio might try its hand at a smaller and less expensive film. <p>
        Chris Sanders was approached by <strong>Thomas Schumacher</strong> to pitch that idea, and Sanders reused the "Stitch" character he came up with. The storyline required a remote, non-urban location, so Sanders chose Kauaʻi as the location. Stitch became the central character of the 2002 film Lilo & Stitch, which Sanders co-directed and co-wrote with Dean DeBlois. Sanders would also end up voicing the character he created for the film. </p> <p>
            The film's commercial and critical success spawned a franchise with three sequel films and three television series, with Sanders reprising his role of Stitch throughout the original 2002–06 run of the franchise <q>Sanders did not reprise his role for the English dub of the anime Stitch! or the English-language-produced Chinese animated series Stitch & Ai, with Ben Diskin taking over the role for both series</q>, as well in several later Disney crossover works such as Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Kinect: Disneyland Adventures, and the Disney Infinity series.</p>

        <p>One of the things that I believe that makes this animated movie even more special than it already is, is its <a href="lyrics.html" title="Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride">themesong</a>.</p>
